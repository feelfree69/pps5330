# Reverse Engineered Firmware for the ELV PPS5330 Power Supply

The PPS5330 Power supply is controlled by an ATMEGA88PA microcontroller.
The firmware has been developed from scratch by Rolf D., see this thread in the german forum: https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/499101

Current status:
- All Basic functionality is working, the Power Supply is in a usable state 
- Added Temperature measuring of the internal heatsink with display on LCD 
- Voltage Calibration done

TO DO:
- Current Calibration
- Calibration of internal ADC measurements
- Menu with LCD contrast/backlit settings
